Hello, i have created a website replicating a retreat center as a getaway with fully operational links leading to different aspects of 
the website informing of contact, menu food options, live events that are hosted within the center, location, and the home link for general info.

Home - contains two photos showcasing the centers services to doing events and recreational activities. And a welcome statement with a small overview of 
the websites/facilities purpose.

contact - I included a contact form for inquiries where users can submit their info and must complete the required boxes with an optionl feedback box for
any questions or concerns.

menu - of course with a vacation center comes a menu, I stylized it with a light border and two photos to showcase some items on the menu. 

location - Using the iframe embeded tool off of google I searched a general area where the center is hypothetically located so users can click 
on it and be directed to google maps with the direct address next to the link. 

Events - as part of the retreat the events link will lead to an overview of a few events we hold for the stayers so they can see what is required as part of the 
program and even an open community event for any locals to hopefully attract some new comers curious of the center. Otherwise it is for the ones who are attending 
the program 

Thank You :)
